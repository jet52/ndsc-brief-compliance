# RULE 30. REFERENCES TO THE RECORD

**(a) In General.** In any document submitted to the supreme court, references to evidence or other parts of the record must include a citation to a register of actions index number or to the location in the recording where such evidence or other material appears. The reference must include, either in the document text or the citation itself, information identifying the item, for example “Statement of John Doe.”

**(b) Form of Citation.**

> **(1)** Reference to any material that is contained in an item in the record and that is listed under a register of actions index number, including transcripts, must be made by setting forth in parentheses the capital letter “R” followed by the index number of the item followed by a colon and the specific page within the item where the information referred to is located, for example (R156:12). If applicable, paragraph or line numbers must be included after the page number, for example (R156:12:¶3) or (R156:12:3). Where more than one district court record must be cited, on first reference to the matter include the entire district court case number (54-2020-CV-00012 R19:2), and on subsequent references include only the last four digits (0012 R19:2).

> **(2)** References to a video or audio recording in the record must be made by identifying the recording and providing specific, time-coded locations of the relevant portions.
