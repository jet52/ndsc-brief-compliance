**(b) Appellant's Brief.** The appellant's brief must contain, under appropriate headings and in the order indicated:

> (7) the argument, which must contain:

> > (A) appellant's contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies; and

> > (B) for each issue:

> > > (i) a concise statement of the applicable standard of review (which may appear in the discussion of the issue or under a separate heading placed before the discussion of the issues);

> > > (ii) citation to the record showing that the issue was preserved for review; or a statement of grounds for seeking review of an issue not preserved; and

> > (C) if the appeal is from a judgment ordered under [N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(b)](/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp/54), whether the certification was appropriate; and

> > (D) a short conclusion stating the precise relief sought.

**(c) Appellee's Brief.** The appellee's brief must conform to the requirements of subdivision (b), except that none of the following need appear unless the appellee is dissatisfied with the appellant's statement:

> (1) the jurisdictional statement;

> (2) the statement of the issues;

> (3) the statement of the case;

> (4) the statement of the facts; and

> (5) the statement of the standard of review.

**(d) Reply Brief.** The appellant may file a single brief in reply to the appellee's brief. Unless the court permits, no further briefs may be filed. A reply brief must contain a table of contents, with paragraph references, and a table of authorities—cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes, and other authorities—with references to the paragraphs in the reply brief where they are cited.

**(e) References to Parties.**  Except as required under Rule 14, counsel should use the parties' actual names or the designations used in the lower court or agency proceeding, or such descriptive terms as "the employee," "the injured person," "the taxpayer," "the purchaser."

**(f) References to the Record.** References to the record must be made as provided by Rule 30.

**(g) Reproduction of Statutes, Rules, Regulations, and Other Sources.** If the court's determination of the issues presented requires the study of statutes, rules, regulations, etc., the relevant parts must be set out in the brief or in an addendum at the end of the brief.

**(h) Oral Arguments Requested.** Any party who desires oral argument must place the words "ORAL ARGUMENT REQUESTED" conspicuously on the cover page of the appellant's, appellee's or cross-appellee's reply brief.

**(i) Briefs in a Case Involving a Cross-Appeal.**

> (1) An appellee and cross-appellant must file a single brief at the time the appellee's brief is due. This brief must contain the issues and argument involved in the cross-appeal as well as the answer to the appellant's brief.

> (2) The appellant's answer to the cross-appeal must be included in the reply brief, but without duplication of statements, arguments, or authorities contained in the appellant's principal brief. To avoid duplication, references may be made to the appropriate portions of the appellant's principal brief.

> (3) The cross-appellant may file a reply brief confined strictly to the arguments raised in the cross-appeal. This brief is due within 14 days after service of the appellant's reply brief; however, if there is less than 14 days before oral argument, the reply brief must be filed at least 5 days before argument.

**(j) Briefs In a Case Involving Multiple Parties.** Any number of parties may join in a single brief or adopt by reference any part of another's brief. Parties may similarly join in reply briefs.

**(k) Citation of Supplemental Authorities.** If pertinent and significant authorities come to a party's attention after the party's brief has been filed—or after oral argument but before decision—a party may promptly advise the court by letter, with a copy to all other parties, setting forth the citations. The letter must state without argument the reasons for the supplemental citations, referring either to the page of the brief or to a point argued orally. Any response must be made promptly and must be similarly limited.

**(l) Requirements.** All briefs under this rule must be concise, presented with accuracy, logically arranged with proper headings, and free from burdensome, irrelevant or immaterial matters.
